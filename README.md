## Overview

![screenshot](/cover.png)

This was my shot at the full stack Image Uploader, a simple project but a functionality that is usefull in almost every real life projects. In the demo you can drag and drop a image or select from your files, it will upload the file to the backend that you save it and return a link to access the file of the image.

Even though it is a simple and small project, I treated it with all the seriousness that I would treat a real project, always seeking to organize the code, use clean code paradigms, use good tools and libraries, create robust and reusable solutions, as was done with error handling, transferring the best regardless of the size of the project.

All code was written in TypeScript both frontend and backend. I listed bellow the tools used in the project:
